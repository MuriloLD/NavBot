## Development of an Autonomous Navigation Robot

This project snapshots the development of an autonomous navigation robot.

The bot is based on a modified chassis kit from Pololu called Zumo.

The idea is to implement, experiment with and evaluate various techniques used to enable robots to independently navigate their environs.

The ultimate goal is to create a collection of useful components that can be applied to real world applications.


##The Snapshots

The project is broken up into subfolders containing snapshots of the development with accompainging documentation.

Current snapshots are: 

 * **NavBot_v1** - **---work-in-progress---** Initial version that uses dead reckoning via high resolution optical encoders on the wheels.  
 
##Planned Features/Support

 * Compass
 * Beacons/triangulation
 * Mapping
 * GPS
 * IMU/Inertia
 * Waypoints
 * Obstacle avoidance
